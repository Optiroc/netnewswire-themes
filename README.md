# netnewswire-themes
a set of themes for the [netnewswire](https://netnewswire.com) rss reader.

both use the [univers](https://www.linotype.com/680064/univers-next-family.html) font family for the best look. if the univers font family is not installed satisfaction is not guaranteed.

the `otlroc` theme variant is preferred for top [aicherung](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otl_Aicher).


## installation

clone the repo or use the "download zip" function, then open any of the `.nnwtheme` bundles. if you have netnewswire on your mac it should automatically prompt you to install the themes.
